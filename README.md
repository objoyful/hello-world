A simple Hello World program.

Hi, this is our first program!
It's so  we can see how GitHub works!
So cool!

# Markdown Syntax

I will also explain the markdown syntax.

Typing normal text will display normal text.

You must put one line of empty space to separate sentences.

## Italics and Bold

To make a word _italic_, you must pyt a `_` before and after the word.

EX: `_italic_`

To make a word **bold** you add `**` before and after the word.

EX: `**bold**`

You can also make a word **_Italic and Bold_** (using both `_` and `**`) and you can **_use it on multiple words_**.

EX: `**_multiple words_**`

## Headers

You can make headers with the hash mark `#`.

You can go from Header 1 to Header 6 by using more `#`.

EX: `# Header 1`
# Header 1

`## Header 2`
## Header 2

`### Header 3`
### Header 3

`#### Header 4`
#### Header 4

`##### Header 5`
##### Header 5

`###### Header 6`
###### Header 6

## Links

To make a link to another website, you put the description in brackets `[]` and the website in parenthesis `()`.

EX: `[Visit GitHub!](https://github.com)`

[Visit GitHub!](https://github.com)

You can also make links that redirect to another place in the document.

EX: `Join [GitHub][github]!`

`[github]: https://www.github.com`

Join [GitHub][github]!

[github]: https://www.github.com/

## Images

Images work just like links, but you have an `!` in front.

The text in the brackes `[]` is called `alt text` in case if the image doesn't load correctly

EX: `![some image](https://www.somewebsite.com/somewebpage/someimage.jpg)`

![some image](https://www.comewebsite/somewebpage/someimage.jpg)
